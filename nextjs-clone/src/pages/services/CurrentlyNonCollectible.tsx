              What is IRS Not-Collectible Status?
            </h2>
            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              Simply put, if the IRS receives proof that the taxpayer is unable
              to pay the tax debt and an account is listed as currently
              non-collectible, the IRS will stop trying to collect back taxes.
              Although it does not remove any tax debt owed by the IRS or
              attempt to settle it, CNC status is an important option for
              taxpayers who cannot afford to pay the back taxes they owe when
              filing their income tax return.
            </p>

            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-8 leading-relaxed">
              The IRS ceases all collection activities including issuing
              garnishment and levy orders once a taxpayer has been declared CNC,
              but they will apply your tax refunds toward your tax debt. The IRS
              sends a taxpayer an annual statement outlining the tax owed. The
              annual statement is not considered to be a bill.

              How to Obtain Currently Not Collectible Status
            </h2>
            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              When facing economic hardship, you can apply to be listed as
              currently not-collectible by consulting a tax attorney or by
              contacting the IRS directly using Form 433F, Collection
              Information Statement. You should ask the IRS for an updated tax
              balance, which will include interest and penalties.

                    The IRS will first look at any nest egg you might have, such
                    as a savings account to pay your taxes. The IRS will ask you
                    to show proof of your total positive income and expenses if
                    you don't have assets to pay off the debt. The IRS wants to
                    know if you can make tax payments toward the debt with
                    installment agreements.
