              Admittedly, taxes are supposed to serve the greater good, so most
              people are not completely against paying them. But, what happens
              when you cannot afford your taxes or your taxes do not get paid
              resulting in tax debt? When this happens, a lien gets placed
              against your property.
            </p>

            <p className="text-gray-700 mb-8">
              A lien is a legal claim against an asset or assets to ensure that
              a debt or obligation will be paid or fulfilled. An asset may be
              subject to a tax lien if the owner of that item has failed to pay
              taxes. Because doing so makes it simpler for the property owner to
              sell the assets or gain access to lines of credit, the property
              owner has a strong incentive to pay the tax debt or take the
              actions necessary to eliminate the tax lien.

              What is a Tax Lien?
            </h2>
            <p className="mb-6 text-gray-700">
              A lien is a charge or encumbrance placed on another person's
              property to secure the payment of a debt or obligation, according
              to the legal definition of the term. Liens indicate a claim
              against a property, but they do not affect the owner's legal
              claim.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-8 text-gray-700">
              Liens get classified into common-law liens, consensual liens, and
              statutory liens. In the United States, the tax lien is a statutory
              lien created by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Moreover,
              General Tax Liens, sometimes known as "secret" or "silent" liens,
              are the most common type of federal tax liens.

              A tax lien is a notice from the government that you have a tax

              your property taxes.

              By far, the simplest way to get rid of a tax lien is to fully pay

              What Happens to a Mortgage when Real Estate is Seized?
            </h2>
            <p className="mb-6 text-gray-700">
              When governments foreclose on properties under their control
              because of unpaid taxes, this is known as a tax levy. Due to the
              superiority of federal tax liens over other liens, their
              foreclosure cancels out all other liens, including mortgage liens.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-6 text-gray-700">
              Once the real estate is sold at auction by the IRS, the proceeds
              go towards the amount owed to the federal government. Should the
              amount the real estate is sold for not satisfy the amount owed to
              the federal government, the taxpayer must still satisfy any
              remaining tax debt.

                <strong>Redemption Period:</strong> After the auction of seized
                property, there is a period called the redemption period. During
                this time, the owner has the opportunity to try to redeem their
                property by paying any taxes owed.

              Conclusion
            </h2>
            <p className="mb-8 text-gray-700">
              In the hands of seasoned investors who are well-versed in the real
              estate market, property tax liens may provide a lucrative
              alternative investment opportunity. However, due to the extensive
              due diligence required in tax lien investing, it may be worthwhile
              to consider making a passive investment through a member
              institution of the National Tax Lien Association.
