              Bank levies allows creditors to access your bank account funds.
              Your bank will freeze funds in your account and require the bank
              to send this money to creditors to pay your debt.
            </p>

            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              To request funds from your bank account from a creditor, you must
              send a request to your bank proving there is a legal judgment
              against you. Some government creditors like the Internal Revenue
              Service (IRS) don't require a court judgment.

                    After your creditor requests it, your bank will immediately
                    freeze your account and examine the situation – and you may
                    not be notified. Financial institutions can provide contact
                    information to the creditor if you aren't sure who is levied
                    on your account.

              Bank levies are usually followed by less formal collection
              attempts like collection calls. To levy an account, most lenders
              need to file a lawsuit against your account to obtain court
              approval. If the creditor is successful, the court will issue a
              money judgment stating how much you owe. This is your best and
              most important opportunity to dispute the amount owed.

              Tax Levies vs. Tax Liens
            </h3>
            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              A tax levy is different from a tax lien in that a lien is security
              in support of tax debt, whereas a levy is a process of actually
              taking property used to satisfy a tax liability. If you have
              unpaid debt, and you have not made arrangements to pay that debt,
              the IRS may seize any of the following:

            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              If the IRS determines you are available to be levied, this method
              is usually only issued after certain requirements are met by the

              Creditors may use a wage garnishment and levy a percentage of an
              employee's wage. Before garnishing your wages, lenders will need
              to obtain the appropriate legal documents from a court. Federal
              and state laws determine the maximum amount that can be garnished.
              It is often set at 25%.

              Mortgage lending can also forbid the sale of real estate. They can
              put a lien on your house and force you to sell it (called
              foreclosure sales) or pay you when you sell it. The proceeds of
              the sale are used to "lift" the lien.

              A writ can be obtained from a court to seize personal properties.
              A writ allows a sheriff, or another public official, to enter your
              home or business to seize assets (such as cash registers, boats,
              jewelry, etc.). The proceeds can be applied to the debt by selling
              the property at a public auction.
