                What is a Trust Fund Recovery Penalty?
              </h2>
              <p className="mb-6 text-gray-700">
                When a corporation has unpaid Form 941 liability (Employer's
                Quarterly Federal Tax Return), the IRS could affirm the Trust
                Fund Recovery Penalty ("TFRP") against the shareholders,
                directors, officers, owners, or employees of a company. By
                taking this action, the IRS asserts the corporation's TFRP
                liability against the people that run the business and will
                collect this liability from their assets.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-6 text-gray-700">
                Compared to other types of IRS fines and penalties that can be
                added to the total tax liability owed for that tax year, the
                Trust Fund Recovery Penalty does more than increase the tax balance due. This penalty has the ability to assign
                responsibility to an individual or group of people who
                "willfully" failed to pay what was owed in taxes.
              </p>

                <p className="text-gray-700">
                  <strong>Important:</strong> The Trust Fund Recovery Penalty is
                  one of the most serious fines that can be asserted by the IRS,
                  and if you are found to be the responsible person for paying
                  trust fund taxes, the IRS will not hesitate to come for your
                  personal assets as a means of collecting what is owed in tax
                  debt.

              <p className="mb-6 text-gray-700">
                As a wage employee who earns payroll, you have the luxury of
                leaving the organization of employment taxes to your employer.
                Your employer is responsible for withholding income taxes,
                Social Security taxes, and Medicare taxes from your pay instead
                of paying you the entire amount earned. These withheld funds are
                called trust fund taxes because they are then kept in a trust
                fund where they will reside until it is time for the employer to
                pay employment taxes and make a Federal Tax Deposit to the
                Treasury.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-6 text-gray-700">
                Deducting the correct amount from employees' paychecks is the
                best way to avoid problems in the future. By consistently
                withdrawing money from wages and placing the appropriate
                percentage in a trust fund, employers can maintain a regular
                quarterly schedule of paying the IRS.

                In determining whether to assert the Trust Fund Recovery Penalty
                against an individual, the IRS looks at various factors
                involving the party's responsibility and willfulness to pay
                employment taxes. If you are being investigated regarding a
                Trust Fund Recovery Penalty, there are ways to contest with the
                appeals office the process if you can prove that you were not
                the responsible party or did not willfully fail to make tax
                payments.

                The IRS understands that not all businesses are run the same,
                and the individuals responsible for certain financial tasks may
                have a different job title to that of someone who completes the
                same roles in another company. To accommodate the varying
                business structures of companies that may be involved with a
                Trust Fund Recovery Penalty, the IRS conducts a highly factual
                analysis that reviews all of the duties and responsibilities of
                employees across different roles in the company.

              <p className="mb-6 text-gray-700">
                The IRS also looks at how willing the responsible person is to
                pay trust fund taxes. To be asserted the TFRP, the responsible
                party must have both been aware of the outstanding taxes and
                either intentionally disregarded the responsibility or willfully fails to pay.

                Penalty is a hefty fine that is equal to the unpaid balance of
                trust fund taxes withheld. This sum is calculated based on both

                Whether the willful failure of paying trust fund taxes is
                through negligence or intentionally disregarded, most of the
                time when people fail to pay their tax liability, it is due to
                financial hardship. Upon the breakdown of how Trust Fund
                Recovery Penalties are calculated, it is clear to see that the
                fine can double the tax debt of the responsible person.

                What happens when you have unpaid trust fund taxes?
              </h3>
              <p className="mb-6 text-gray-700">
                When a company is being investigated for the accumulation of
                unpaid taxes that have been withheld from their employees, an
                IRS revenue officer will evaluate the potentially responsible persons to be held personally liable for the tax issue. During
                the investigation process, corporate officers will request
                thorough financial documentation and information from the
                company to determine which potentially responsible persons have
                the decision-making authority to withhold and pay employment
                taxes.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-6 text-gray-700">
                During this process, the IRS may summon the company owner or
                person they think is responsible for the missing tax payments to
                complete a Form 4180 Interview to assess their potential role in
                the arisen tax issues. The interview investigates the extent of
                the individual's role and responsibilities in the company to
                determine if they should be held responsible for the willful
                failure of paying trust fund taxes.

                IRS Collection Efforts

              <p className="mb-6 text-gray-700">
                If the IRS determines that you are the responsible party for
                paying trust fund taxes but they have yet to receive payment,
                they will issue a letter stating their intention to assess the
                Trust Fund Recovery Penalty against you. The responsible person
                has 60 days from the date the letter was sent to appeal the TFRP
                proposal, but if you fail to respond to the letter, you will
                receive a Notice and Demand for Payment.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-8 text-gray-700">
                Once the TFRP has been formally issued against you, the IRS can
                file a federal tax lien or issue a bank levy to take collection
                action. When someone owes outstanding tax debt to the
                government, IRS collection efforts can include levies or
                garnishments on wages, levies on bank accounts, and the seizure
                of assets to help ensure the tax debt will be paid.

                Can you settle Trust Fund Recovery Penalties?

              <p className="mb-6 text-gray-700">
                Similar to other tax liabilities you may accumulate, there are
                options when it comes to managing your tax debt and paying what
                you owe to the IRS. If the IRS assesses a company's tax
                liability and determines that the potentially responsible person
                is necessarily liable, the best method to remove a Trust Fund
                Recovery Penalty is to pay what is owed in trust fund taxes
                every quarter to avoid the penalty being issued.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-8 text-gray-700">
                If a company is unable to pay the full amount owed in trust fund
                taxes or once a TFRP has been issued, you can consult a tax
                professional to help you settle with the IRS.

                It can be challenging to navigate the legal nuances of the
                internal revenue code when facing the consequences of unpaid

                Recovery Penalty, consulting tax professionals like those at
                Ideal Tax can help you issue an appeal and restore your good
                standing with the IRS.
