              Liabilities are accrued when a taxpayer has failed to file an
              income tax return or when the IRS files a Substitute for Return
              ("SFR") or "force files" for the taxpayer. The IRS will file the
              form 1040-X return on the taxpayer's behalf, giving them zero
              deductions, exaggerating the liability, and placing the taxpayer
              in the highest bracket possible. Most people would not file this
              way, and this may cause large balances for every year an SFR is
              filed.

              IRS Form 1040-X is the form that you use to correct or amend your

              changes you made to your amended forms, as well as the correct tax
              amount, which could make you eligible for a tax refund.
