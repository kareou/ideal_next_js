            </h2>
            <p className="mb-6">
              Installment agreements allow you to pay your tax debt over time
              through monthly payments:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-6 space-y-2">

            </h2>
            <p className="mb-6">
              An Offer in Compromise allows you to settle your tax debt for less
              than the full amount owed. The IRS considers three scenarios:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-6 space-y-2">
              <li>

                the full amount
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Doubt as to liability:</strong> Dispute over the amount
                owed

                <strong>Effective tax administration:</strong> Would cause
                economic hardship
              </li>

              Currently Not Collectible (CNC) Status
            </h2>
            <p className="mb-6">
              If you're experiencing financial hardship, the IRS may place your
              account in Currently Not Collectible status, temporarily stopping
              collection activities while you're unable to pay.
            </p>
