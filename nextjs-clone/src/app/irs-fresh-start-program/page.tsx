            <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-8 leading-relaxed">

                <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  These plans are tailored for taxpayers who need an extended
                  period to pay off their tax debt. Typically, individuals can
                  make payments over an extended duration, often up to 72
                  months, and in some cases, even up to 84 months.

                  Another option for taxpayers struggling to make full payments,
                  these plans allow taxpayers to make smaller, more manageable
                  payments over time. However, it's important to note that
                  interest and penalties continue to accrue.

                In many cases, taxpayers can significantly reduce their tax debt
                by leveraging the statute of limitationsâ€”a sort of expiration
                date for debt set by the IRS for collecting the amount owed. Our
                team of tax professionals is equipped to assist you in
                maximizing this time limit by negotiating for a lower monthly
                payment, allowing a substantial portion of your debt to expire.

                  Offer in Compromise (OIC)
                </h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  If you're unable to meet the requirements of a traditional
                  payment plan, the Offer in Compromise (OIC) might be your
                  ticket to tax debt freedom. OIC allows you to settle your tax
                  debt for less than the full amount owed. To qualify, you must
                  demonstrate that paying the full amount would create a
                  financial hardship. The IRS evaluates your financial
                  situation, and if you qualify, a non-refundable deposit is
                  required, typically set at 20% of your offer amount.

                  If making any payments on your tax debt seems impossible due
                  to severe financial limitations, Currently Non-Collectible
                  Status offers a breather. Under this status, the IRS
                  temporarily halts debt collection until your financial
                  situation improves. To be eligible, you need to show that
                  paying the full amount would put a serious financial strain on
                  you.
