              Form W-9, Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and
              Certification, is used by businesses to collect information from
              independent contractors, freelancers, and other service providers.
              The contractor fills out this form to provide their taxpayer
              identification number (TIN) and other identifying information.

            <p className="mb-6">
              Form 1099 is an information return that businesses use to report
              payments made to non-employees during the tax year. There are
              several types of 1099 forms, with 1099-NEC (Non-Employee
              Compensation) being the most common for independent contractor
              payments.

            </h2>

              Businesses must request Form W-9 from contractors before making
              payments and issue Form 1099-NEC if they pay $600 or more during
              the tax year. Failure to comply can result in backup withholding
              and penalties.
